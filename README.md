# Automobile Evaluation Data Summary
## Overview


This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about thousands of cars, focusing on specific attributes. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and modified for illustrative purposes. 

The analysis covers:

Summarizing Manufacturer Country: Frequency analysis of car manufacturers' countries.

Summarizing Buying Costs: Categorical variable analysis, including ordering and median calculation.

Summarizing Luggage Capacity: Categorical variable proportions and handling missing values.

Summarizing Passenger Capacity: Count and proportion of cars with 5 or more doors.

# Code Structure
Summarizing Manufacturer Country: Counts and identifies the 4th most frequent manufacturer country.
Summarizing Buying Costs: Lists unique values, orders them, and calculates the median category.
Summarizing Luggage Capacity: Calculates proportions and checks for missing values
Summarizing Passenger Capacity: Counts and calculates proportions for cars with 5+ doors.

# Usage
Ensure you have the required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) installed.
Replace 'car_eval_dataset.csv' with your dataset path.
Run the code sections sequentially.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic data summarization techniques for categorical variables in a car evaluation dataset. Adapt and extend these techniques for your own data analysis needs. If you have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
